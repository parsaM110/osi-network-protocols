🛰️ **Osmocom** (short for *Open Source Mobile Communications*) is a collaborative project that develops open-source software for mobile communications systems. It covers everything from GSM and LTE stacks to SDR (Software Defined Radio) tools. The website [osmocom.org](https://osmocom.org/projects/gr-osmosdr/wiki) serves as the central hub for its various subprojects, documentation, and community resources.

🔧 One of its key components for SDR is **gr-osmosdr**, a GNU Radio source block that allows interfacing with a wide range of SDR hardware like RTL-SDR, HackRF, bladeRF, and USRP devices. It provides a unified API for different devices, making it easier to build radio applications across platforms.

🚫 As for its status in GNU Radio:
- **gr-osmosdr was never officially part of GNU Radio** itself—it’s always been a separate, external module.
- In recent GNU Radio versions (especially post v3.9), **some users have reported difficulty finding or installing Osmocom blocks**, often due to compatibility issues or missing dependencies.
- There’s a shift toward using **gr-soapy**, which is more integrated into modern GNU Radio builds and supports many of the same devices.

If you're working with SDR hardware and missing Osmocom blocks in GNU Radio Companion (GRC), you might need to:
- Manually build `gr-osmosdr` from source using the correct branch for your GNU Radio version.
- Or consider switching to `gr-soapy`, which is actively maintained and supports a wide range of SDRs.

Want help setting up one of these alternatives or troubleshooting your build? I’ve got your back.

### 🧱 **Core Topics to Include**

Here’s a breakdown of sections that would help people grasp wireless protocols from beginner to expert:

#### 📚 Protocol Overview Pages
- **Name & Description**
- **Use Cases** (IoT, mobile, industrial, etc.)
- **Standardizing Body** (IEEE, 3GPP, etc.)
- **Typical Applications** (smart home, smartphone, industrial sensors)

#### 📶 Frequency & Spectrum Tables
- **Operating Frequency Bands**
- **Licensed vs. Unlicensed Bands**
- **Global Region Variations**
- **RF Spectrum Charts** (visual grids for Wi-Fi, Zigbee, LTE, etc.)

#### 🧬 Layer Mapping & Stack Architecture
- Protocol → OSI Layers involved
- Custom stack if applicable (e.g., Zigbee stack vs TCP/IP vs LTE stack)
- Links to modulation types (QAM, OFDM, DSSS…)

#### 🔗 Protocol Interoperability
- How they interact with higher layers (HTTP over LTE, CoAP over Zigbee)
- Gateway translations (e.g., Zigbee-to-IP bridges)

#### ⚙️ Technical Specs
- Max Data Rate, Range, Power Usage
- Latency, Topology (star/mesh/etc.)
- Security (encryption, authentication support)
- Modulation schemes

### 🛠️ **Hands-on & Implementation Sections**

If you’re aiming to connect dots for learners and devs, this part is gold:

#### 🧪 Packet Examples & Decoding
- **Scapy** captures and dissections (great for Wi-Fi, BLE, Zigbee)
- PCAP samples with walk-throughs
- Highlight header fields, payload formats

#### 🔌 Driver & Stack Implementation Insights
- Links to C/Linux kernel drivers
- Open-source protocol implementations (e.g., OpenZigbee, Osmocom, lwIP)
- Kernel module diagrams for advanced users

#### 🧰 Developer Tooling
- SDR tools for GSM/LTE (gr-osmosdr, SDRangel)
- BLE sniffing tools (BtleJack, Wireshark plugins)
- Zigbee protocol analyzers
- Simulation environments (NS-3, OMNeT++)

---

### 🗺️ **Connecting the Dots Section**
Something not found in most docs but hugely valuable:
- Comparison tables (data rate vs. range vs. power vs. cost)
- When to use what (e.g., “Zigbee vs BLE in smart home” cheat sheet)
- “From Bit to Webpage” walk-through: tracing how data travels through LTE or Wi-Fi

---

### 🤖 Optional Fun Extensions
- Protocol history & trivia (Zigbee’s origin, LTE evolution)
- “Signal Stories” showcasing real-world use cases
- Quizzes to test understanding or diagram labeling

Would you like help drafting the folder and file structure of the repo so it’s clean from the start? I can scaffold a structure in Markdown and add a few example files to get things rolling. You’re about to build something awesome.
